# cancer_detection

In this project I have tried to implement Convolutional Neural Network to detect the types of Skin cancer. 
Data is not present in this repository.

You will need to follow the below instructions to get data.
You will need to download the images from this 3 places 
https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-dlnfd/datasets/skin-cancer/train.zip
https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-dlnfd/datasets/skin-cancer/valid.zip
https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-dlnfd/datasets/skin-cancer/test.zip

All the three will have images  of 3 types of cancer. You will need to create the directory data in the same file structure. 
Inside data folder you will need to create 3 folder melanoma, nevus, seborrheic_keratosis. You will need to get the images 
from all the 3 sources and paste them in the corresponding folder.

Your file structure should look like this 

data/

     melanoma/....(all images)

     nevus/...(all images)

     seborrheic_keratosis/...(all images )

main.py

model.py

...



The work is inspired from the paper (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=0ahUKEwiN_ZXv5pLcAhVLWH0KHdLsAiIQFggwMAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ijarcs.info%2Findex.php%2FIjarcs%2Farticle%2Fdownload%2F2402%2F2390&usg=AOvVaw0atO-ES9ECwhFj_pSOtv_p)
